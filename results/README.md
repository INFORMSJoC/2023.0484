# Results Description

* The results obtained by MIP and BnP are in the [MIP](MIP) and [BnP](BnP) folders, respectively, and are classified by instance in the folder.

* The results at the root node obtained using MP and MP-SP are in the [root_mp](root_mp) and [root_mpsp](root_mpsp) folders, respectively.

* The results obtained by CG-based Heuristic are in the [Heuristic](Heuristic) folder.
