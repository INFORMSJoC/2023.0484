## Description

The goal of this repository is to share data and results related to the Robust Drone-Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (RDVRRPTW), solved using our solution approaches.

## Building

We develop exact and heuristic algorithms to solve the Robust Drone-Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (RDVRRPTW) through a Branch-and-Price framework. Additionally, we decompose the column generation subproblem into two optimization problems, resulting in a two-phase column generation algorithm.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Libraries: Cplex, NumPy, Numba

### Structure

The source code is available in the [src](src) directory and includes the following components:

- `main.py`: 
  - Defines the `Prob` class, which manages the problem data.
  - Contains the `MIPSolver` class, which solve MIP model.
  - Contains the `BnPSolver` class, which solve Branch-and-Price algorithm.
  - Contains the `HeuristicSolver` class, which solve CG-based Heuristic algorithm.
- `mp_root.py`: Define the `MP` class, which solve the extended master formulation (MP).
- `mpsp_root.py`: Define the `MP` class, which solve the set-partitioning master formulation (MP-SP).

### Run

At the bottom of each python file, set the path and required parameter values for the instance as follows:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':


    datafile = 'problems/solomon/25/R101.txt'

    prob = Prob(datafile=datafile,
        T_Gamma = 2, t_range = 0.25,
        D_Delta = 2, d_range = 0.25,
        num_drones = 2,
        drone_time_multiplier = 0.25,
        drone_cost_multiplier = 0.25,
        flight_limit = 25,
        demand_ratio = 0.75,

    )


    bnp_solver = BnPSolver(prob, num_cpus=8, sp_time_limit=10)
    bnp_results = bnp_solver.solve(time_limit=3600, decomposition_level=1)

```

Then, excute the program as follows:

```bash
python main.py
```
